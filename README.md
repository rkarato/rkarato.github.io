# Assessment 1.AWS
*************************************************************************************************************************
Please be aware of the fact that we are not only looking at the actual deliverables but also on your road to these designs. We are mostly interested in the person behind the assessment. If the assessment is successful enough, the next step will be a presentation given to some of our team members.
 
The deliverables are:
a time log of your activities and the road to the solutions
per question (1 to 4) a complete answer, including designs and reasoning of chosen components and configurations
if applicable including template files
publish the deliverables to us
Context:
The solution will need to land on AWS
 
******************************************************************
 
A: You have a client which is a webshop. They have a standard Magento setup with MySQL on a single VPS at their current provider and want to bring this to AWS.
The external software (Magento) is managed, developed and maintained by an external party.
 
1. Design an architecture which incorporates the following client needs. The clients know that his whole setup is going to evolve constantly. Include a cloud formation template for programmable infrastructure for your design.
Needs to be scalable and flexible
Needs to have low latency for SEO purposes
Needs to be cost effective
 


AWS provides  

2. After releasing the new architecture, business takes on, and the client decides to add customer reviews.
Do you need to alter your architecture? And if so, how?
 
3. At some point, one of the customer employees is getting very good at creating vlogs, and the client wants to give customers the opportunity to upload videos with their reviews. They want to store the thumbnails and videos for later processing, and they want to show thumbnails of the videos underneath the product pages.
Alter your architecture to process and store these videos.
 
4. At some point, some clients uploaded non-compliant video's and which created a huge marketing issue. The client now wants to screen the uploaded video's before putting them online, but with minimal costs.
Alter your architecture to be able to screen and process these video's.
 
******************************************************************
We are looking forward to your assessment and love to hear when you expect to deliver it to us. Keep in mind that it is not about speed, but quality.




# Magento on AWS

AWS provides flexible infrastucture for requirements of all sizes. 

As a pioneer in the creation of what is now called Cloud, AWS still drives the Cloud services with an ever growing number of services, that bottomline, serve more and more clients.

A multitude of those clients run e-commerce web sites that are based on Open Source software Magento. The recurrence of customers requiring this platform setup on the cloud, led to the creation of packaged solutions that can be easily implemented.

There are 2 different ways to create a Magento platform in AWS - LightSail and Cloudformation.

LightSail provides entry level infrastructure that is managed and can be requested in different sizes, for a fraction of the price.

As a managed service, the operational maintenance of the system is done by the AWS professionals letting you concentrate on running your business.

The downside is that the solution does not allow cater for the ability to change and the processing power is limited to the size of package requested.

With bigger flexibility and growth potential in mind, Cloudformation templates are the next option for a fast deployment that also enables your web site to change and cater for incresing customer traffic and usage.
